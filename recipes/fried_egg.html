    <h2>Meet my favorite fried egg: the crispy olive oil fried egg.</h2>
    <p>fried eggs have golden, lacy, crispy edges, which contrast beautifully with their runny yellow yolks. Contrast is everything!
Start with a good egg, a hot skillet, and a generous drizzle of olive oil, and you’ll end up with the most flavorful fried egg you’ve ever tasted. They are infinitely better than the rubbery, sulfurous eggs that come out of non-stick skillets. In fact, these are the only fried eggs I ever want to eat.</p>

    <h2>Steps to make Fried Egg</h2>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>
            Heat the pan
            <ul>
                <li>Place a non-stick frying pan on medium heat.</li>
                <li>Add a little oil or butter and let it warm up (but not burn).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Crack the egg
            <ul>
                <li>Gently crack the egg on the side of the pan or a flat surface.</li>
                <li>Open it carefully and let the egg slide into the pan without breaking the yolk.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook the egg
            <ul>
                <li>Let the egg cook until the whites turn solid and are no longer transparent.</li>
                <li>For sunny-side up: don’t flip the egg, just cook until whites are set.</li>
                <li>For over-easy: gently flip the egg with a spatula and cook for a few more seconds.</li>
                <li>For over-hard: flip and cook longer until the yolk is fully cooked.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Season

        </li>
        <li>
            Serve
            <ul>
                <li>Carefully slide the egg onto a plate.</li>
                <li>Enjoy it plain, with bread, or on top of rice/noodles.</li>
